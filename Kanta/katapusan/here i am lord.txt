I, the lord of sea and sky,
i have heard my people cry.
all who dwell in dark and sin
my hand will save.
i who made stars of night,
i will make their darkness bright.
who will bear my light to them?
whom shall i send?

refrain:
here i am, lord. Is it i, lord?
i have heard you calling in the night.
i will go, lord, if you lead me
i will hold your people in my heart.

i, the lord of snow and rain,
i have borne my people's pain.
i have wept for love of them
they turn away.
i will break their hearts of stone,
give them hearts for love alone,
i will speak my word to them.
whom shall i send? 

refrain:
here i am, lord. Is it i, lord?
i have heard you calling in the night.
i will go, lord, if you lead me
i will hold your people in my heart.

i, the lord of wind and flame,
i will tend the poor and lame.
i will set a feast for them,
my hand will save.
finest bread i will provide,
till their hearts be satisfied.
i will give my life to them.
whom shall i send?

refrain:
here i am, lord. Is it i, lord?
i have heard you calling in the night.
i will go, lord, if you lead me
i will hold your people in my heart.
